One way to study pangenomic variation is through comparing the genes present or absent in an operon or gene cluster of interest across your samples. The pangenomic tool, panaroo, outputs a graph which represent the pangenome as a collection of nodes (genes) and edges (whether those genes are adjacent on a contig in a given sample). Using this graph, it is possible to find every possible path between two genes to see the gene combinations present in your samples.
