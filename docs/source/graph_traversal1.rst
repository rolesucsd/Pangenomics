In pangenomics, one mechanism to study strain diversity is through graph traversal which allows you to find which genes are present or absent in an operon or gene cluster of interest. A graph representation of the pangenome is part of the output of the program, Panaroo. The graph represents the pangenome where each node is a gene and each edge represents the genes being adjacent on a contig in one or more of your samples. Through this output, it is possible to find every possible paths between two genes of interest within your samples.
